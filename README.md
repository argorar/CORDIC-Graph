# CORDIC Graph

## What is the CORDIC algorithm?
CORDIC (for Cordinate Rotation Digital Computer),also known as Volder's algorithm, is a simple and efficient algorithm to calculate hyperbolic and trigonometric functions, typically converging with one digit (or bit) per iteration. It is therefore also a prominent example of digit-by-digit algorithms. CORDIC and closely related methods known as pseudo-multiplication and pseudo-division or factor combining are commonly used when no hardware multiplier is available (e.g. in simple microcontrollers and FPGAs), as the only operations it requires are addition, subtraction, bitshift and table lookup.

## What does CORDIC graph?
Based on the frequency and amplitude graphic the trigonometric functions sine and cosine.

## How to run it?
To execute the algorithm run test.m  in Octave.
